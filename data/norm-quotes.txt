"Can I draw you a beer, Norm?"
"No, I know what they look like. Just pour me one."

"All four cheeks & a couple of chins."


"What's going down, Normie?"
"My butt cheeks on that bar stool."


"What would you say to a nice beer, Normie?"
"Going Down?"


"What'll it be, Normie?"
"Just the usual, Coach. I'll have a froth of beer & a snorkel."


"What would you say to a beer, Normie?"
"Daddy wuvs you."


"What'd you like, Normie?"
"A reason to live. Give me another beer."



"What'll you have, Normie?"
"Well, I'm in a gambling mood, Sammy. I'll take a glass of whatever comes out of that tap."
"Looks like beer, Norm."
"Call me Mister Lucky."


"What's new, Norm?"
"Terrorists, Sam. They've taken over my stomach & they're demanding beer."


"How's life treating you?"
"It's not, Sammy, but you can."


"What'd you say, Norm?"
"Any cheap, tawdry thing that will get me a beer."


"What would you say to a beer, Norm?"
"Hiya, sailor. New in town?"


"Whaddya say, Norm?"
"Well, I never met a beer I didn't drink."


"How's about a beer, Norm?"
"That's that amber sudsy stuff, right? I've heard good things about it!"


"Beer, Norm?"
"Have I gotten that predictable? Good."


"Hey Norm, how's the world been treating you?"
"Like a baby treats a diaper."


"Whatcha up to, Norm?"
"My ideal weight if I were eleven feet tall."


"What's the story, Norm?"
"Boy meets beer. Boy drinks beer. Boy meets another beer."

"No, I'd like a dead cat in a glass."


"What's the story, Mr. Peterson?"
"The Bobbsey twins go to the brewery. Let's cut to the happy ending."


"Hey, Mr. Peterson, there's a cold one waiting for you."
"I know. If she calls, I'm not here."


"What's going on, Mr. Peterson?"
"A flashing sign in my gut that says, 'Insert beer here.'"


"Hey Mr. Peterson, Jack Frost nipping at your nose?"
"Yep. Now let's get Joe Beer nipping at my liver, huh?"

"Another layer for the winter Wool."


"How's it going, Mr. Peterson?"
"Poor."
"I'm sorry to hear that."
"No, I mean pour."


"Women. Can't live with 'em....pass the beer nuts."


"Pour you a beer, Mr. Peterson?"
"Alright, but stop me at one... make that one-thirty."


"How's it going, Mr. Peterson?"
"It's a dog-eat-dog world, Woody, & I'm wearing Milk Bone underwear."


"What's going on, Mr. Peterson?"
"The question is what's going in Mr. Peterson? A beer please, Woody."


"Can I pour you a beer, Mr. Peterson?"
"A little early isn't it, Woody?"
"For a beer?"
"No, for stupid questions."
